Th!nk is a crypto currency with a mission: solve worldwide problems through block computing. 

Essentially, scientists and researchers write programs that solve a problem (like finding a cure to cancer, checking the security of encryption algorithms, etc) and utilize computers all over the world (the "Th!nk" peer-to-peer network) to work together to solve it.
