Th!nk is a blockchain platform with a goal: solve worldwide problems through block computing. 

Essentially, scientists and researchers write programs that solve a problem (like finding a cure to cancer, checking the security of encryption algorithms, etc) and utilize computers all over the world (the "Th!nk" peer-to-peer network) to work together to solve it.

In [our example program, finding primes]({{site.myurl}}go), people work together to find prime numbers (numbers that can only be divided by 1 and itself). But, Th!nk is not a prime-finding program. It is a blockchain-based system for solving any and all scientific problems. In this vein, Th!nk is very similar to [BOINC](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/), however, it incentivizes working on science by doubling as a crypt-currency.

Essentially, participants receive Th!nk coin as proof they worked on a scientific problem. They can then send that to other Th!nk users in exchange for goods or services. But, the main object of Th!nk is to further scientific research, and in order to achieve that goal better, a currency based on proof-of-work is used to incentivize people to contribute to science.

**Researchers submit their projects to Th!nk on the blockchain, and users choose which one they want, then run the program**
