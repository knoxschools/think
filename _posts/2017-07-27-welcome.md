Th!nk is a new way to "Th!nk" about cryptocurrency.

Most crypto systems are purely financial systems (such as bitcoin (BTC) and Z-Cash (ZEC)) that work by verifying transactions between people without a hierarchical structure (such as a bank).

However, Ethereum (ETH), implements a virtual machines, which allows people to run their program on the network, and they receive ETH as a result of their running the code. This allows lots of useful applications to be ran, however, it is anonymous and private people's code.

Th!nk (THK), however, is Ethereum but the programs are selected to solve important problems. Instead of running random people's code in exchange for ETH, your computer would actually be making a difference in Medical/Science/Math research areas.
