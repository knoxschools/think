Th!nk is a new way to "Th!nk" about solving problems.

Most blockchain technologies are purely financial systems (such as bitcoin [BTC] and Z-Cash [ZEC]) that work by verifying transactions between people without a hierarchical structure (such as a bank).

However, Ethereum [ETH], implements a virtual machines, which allows people to run their program on the network, and other people receive ETH as a result for running the code. This allows lots of useful applications to be ran, however, it is anonymous and runs random people's code.

Th!nk [THK], however, is similar to Ethereum, but the programs are selected to solve important problems. **Th!nk is not a crypto currency, it is a peer to peer network used to solve science problems**. Instead of running random people's code in exchange for ETH, your computer would actually be making a difference in Medical/Science/Math research areas. Additionally, the Ethereum system has some serious design flaws that make in untrustworthy for a modern research-advancing blockchain (see [here](http://mashable.com/2017/11/08/ethereum-parity-bug/#i7TUq1rw_mq1)).
