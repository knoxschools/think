Th!nk is a new way to "Th!nk" about solving problems.

Most blockchain technologies are purely financial systems (such as bitcoin [BTC] and Z-Cash [ZEC]) that work by verifying transactions between people without a hierarchical structure (such as a bank).

However, Ethereum [ETH], implements a virtual machines, which allows people to run their program on the network, and other people receive ETH as a result for running the code. This allows lots of useful applications to be ran, however, it is anonymous and runs random people's code.

# Th!nk Is Different

Th!nk [THK], like Ethereum, runs code as the base of the blockchain system. However, Th!nk is different: the programs are selected to solve important problems. **Th!nk is not a crypto currency, it is a peer to peer network used to solve science problems**. Instead of running random people's code in exchange for ETH, your computer would actually be making a difference in Medical/Science/Math research areas, and get THK as a reward. Additionally, the Ethereum system has some serious design flaws that make in untrustworthy for a modern research-advancing blockchain (see [here](http://mashable.com/2017/11/08/ethereum-parity-bug/#i7TUq1rw_mq1)). Th!nk uses a proof-of-work algorithm based on the Equihash algorithm, but it is extended to hash arbitrary code execution.


# What Can Th!nk Do?

Th!nk can be used to solve cancer, research medical solutions, or further mathematics. Have a look at other projects, such as [BOINC](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/), and you can see how useful this is. However, when looking at these other research systems, we noticed something: they do not utilize blockchain-based proof-of-work and hashing. With these new advances, the system is more secure and robust. It also incentivizes users to donate their CPU time by giving them THK when they advance science. **Th!nk incentivizes and expands innovation**, and that benefits everyone. It could help cure cancer, research possible biomedical products, research cryptography, and so much more.


# How Can We Trust Th!nk?

And it's only possible through what's called the blockchain. Essentially, bitcoin was the first practical solution to the [Byzantine Generals Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance), which allowed for "trust in a trustless environment". It's a complex solution, too large to be shown here, but using that same technology, we can create a trusted environment (the blockchain) to store scientific data free from tampering.
